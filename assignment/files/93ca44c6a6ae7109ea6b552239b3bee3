What is features of JavaScript
-> Easy SetUp        -> Browser Support
-> Dom Manipilation  -> Event Handling
-> Dynamic Typing    -> Functional Programming
-> Cross-Platform Support -> Object-oriented Programming
-> Builts-in Objects   -> Object Prototype
-> Global Object     -> Builts-in Methods
-> Modular Programming  -> JSON , Asyncrhonous Programming
-> Event - Driven Architecture   -> Server/Client side Support 
-> Light weighted scripting language  -> Dynamic Typing 


Que3 :-

Que6:=>
Difference between undifined and null
Both indicates abesence of value 
undefined means variable declareda not assigned
undefined is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables in certain situations:
Uninitialized Variables,Missing Function Return,Non-Existent Object Properties or Array Elements

null represents intentional absence of value , meaing variable has assigned of value null

Undefined == true  (loose equality considers them equal)
Undefined === false (they are not strictly equal in type).

Que7:->
What is diffrence between == and ===

(==,double equal to) -> loose equality opretar
it converts the values to the same type before comparing them.
Objects or arrays are compared by reference (not content).
(===,Triple equal to) -> Strict equality opretar
Compares both value and type exactly.
Objects or arrays are compared by reference (not content).

Que8:->
What is Function can we Overload function in javascript
unction is a block of code if you want to execute a task again and again then we use function it is reusable
